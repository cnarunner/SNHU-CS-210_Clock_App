# Cplusplus_Program


### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
	*Develop an object-oriented programming (OOP) application to create two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code.

### What did you do particularly well?
	* I think I did a good job of organizing my code and making it readable
### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
	* I really wish I had time to figure out how to make my clock count up in real time. I know this is far beyond the scope of this class, but I thought it would be cool to learn. 
### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
	* I made a function that centered text in the middle of the console. This was harder than I thought it would be, especially when I started splitting this into fractions, no matter what I did, there was a memory overflow. It was incredibly frustrating. My fix was percentages, Once I switched to splitting up the space with a percentage, the memory "magically" fixed itself. 
### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
	* This was my first progect in C++, I learned A LOT about how to program in a C language, this has carried over to every project I have done since.
### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
	* I have comments EVERYWHERE. Everything has a description, it would be hard not to know what this program is doing. Just about everything except the main loop is in its own separate function, this should make it easy to find future problems, or even implement in other programs.
